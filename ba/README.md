# ba - A2A Agent UI, Control, and Orchestration Layer

`ba` is a web application built with Vite and React, designed to serve as a user interface, control panel, and orchestration layer for Agent-to-Agent (A2A) compliant AI agents. It aims to provide a unified interface for interacting with various agents, including the local [ka](https://github.com/tot-ra/ka) agent runtime.

## Purpose

The primary goal of `ba` is to enable users to:

*   Manage and interact with A2A-compliant AI agents.
*   Spawn and control local instances of the `ka` agent.
*   Submit tasks to selected agents with various input types.
*   Monitor task status and view results, including streaming output and artifacts.
*   Eventually, orchestrate complex workflows involving multiple agents.

## Features

`ba` is being developed to include the following features (see [TODO.md](TODO.md) for detailed tasks and progress):

*   **Agent Management:** Add, remove, and list A2A agent endpoints.
*   **Local `ka` Control:** Spawn and stop local `ka` agent processes with configurable settings.
*   **Task Interaction:** Send tasks to selected agents, handle different input types (text, files, data), and receive/display streaming responses and final results.
*   **Task Monitoring:** View the status and history of tasks.
*   **Artifact Handling:** Retrieve and display artifacts generated by agents.
*   **Input Handling:** Provide necessary input to agents when a task requires it.
*   **Orchestration:** (Planned) Define and execute workflows involving multiple agents.
*   **Agent Discovery:** (Planned) Fetch and display agent capabilities from their Agent Cards (`/.well-known/agent.json`).

## A2A Agent Requirements

For effective interaction and future orchestration capabilities within `ba`, A2A-compliant agents are expected to implement the following standard endpoint:

*   **`/agents/update` (POST):** This endpoint, as defined in the A2A specification, allows `ba` (or other control layers) to inform an agent about the presence and details of other agents in the network. Implementing this is crucial for enabling features like agent-to-agent task delegation and collaborative workflows managed by `ba`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js and npm/yarn/pnpm
*   Go (if you plan to spawn local `ka` agents)
*   An A2A-compliant agent running and accessible via a URL (e.g., a running `ka` instance).

### Setup

1.  Navigate to the `ba` directory:
    ```bash
    cd ba
    ```
2.  Install frontend dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install # or yarn install or pnpm install
    ```
3.  Set up the backend for `ba`. The backend is necessary for spawning local `ka` processes and potentially proxying requests to handle CORS or other issues. The choice of backend technology is pending (see [TODO.md](TODO.md)). Follow the backend setup instructions once the technology is decided and implemented.

### Running the Application

1.  Start the `ba` frontend development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev # or yarn dev or pnpm dev
    ```
    The application should now be running at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).
2.  Ensure your A2A agent(s) (including `ka` if desired) are running and accessible.
